    <p>Pratap Singh born on 9 May 1540 popularly known as Maharana Pratap, was a king of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Mewar" target="_blank" style="color:royalblue;">Mewar</a>, a region in north-western India in the present-day state of Rajasthan. He is notable for leading the Rajput resistance against the expansionist policy of the Mughal Emperor Akbar including the Battle of Haldighati and Battle of Dewair which have turned him into a folk hero. Maharana Pratap was born to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udai_Singh_II" target="_blank" style="color:royalblue;">Udai Singh II</a> of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh. His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort was Maharani Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia. Their eldest son was Amar Singh I. He belonged to the Royal family of Mewar. After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisodia_Dynasty" target="_blank" style="color: royalblue;">Sisodia Rajputs</a>. He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies of Akbar, and obtained the town of Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in return for his help.</p>
